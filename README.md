# simple-pwapp
First shot at making a PWA after spending the day going through some codelabs
Let's see if it's possible to put together some simple webapp that is live on the web that can be downloaded by anyone which has some basic functionalities:

##### TODOs
- [ ] p5 responsive canvas
- [ ] recieve notifications when Liverpool is playing
- [ ] have offline capabilites
- [ ] multipages with shared css and js
